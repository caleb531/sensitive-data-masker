# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Sensitive Data Masker ("the Extension") is a Chrome extension that masks the
values of sensitive information like monetary amounts, social security numbers,
and other sensitive values. This is useful if you want to show someone a webpage
without revealing the sensitive information on it.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 14th, 2025.

The Extension does not collect any data from any of the webpages it operates on,
nor does the Extension track visited websites. All user-set Extension options
are stored locally using the [chrome.storage API][storage].

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected
in the Extension's description and on our [GitHub repository][github].
